# knex-todo-cli

This is a Command-line todo app using Knex.

This was the first project created using a database at Dev Academy. Having had some experience with relational databases in the past, I really enjoyed both using a database in this context and the CLI aspect of this project. 

Functions of this project are: Create Read Update (edit title as well as mark a task as complete) and Search. As an additional feature I also added a new column to set a task's priority.

This project was pair programmed with a fellow cohort member.
